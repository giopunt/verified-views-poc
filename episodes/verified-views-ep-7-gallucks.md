  This week your insider influencer fix comes from one of the first men on the
  fashion blogging scene. Our MD Sedge Beswick has brought an old friend onto
  the podcast! Joel Mcloughlin, also known as Gallucks, has taken an alternative
  route into the industry, having previously worked as a stylist for designers,
  fashion apps, television shows, musicians etc. Whilst Joel’s feed is pared
  back, his style choices speak volumes and his iconic monochromatic vibe is
  recognisable anywhere. The versatility he has to be comfortable in different
  styles whilst simultaneously retaining his unique edge, speaks to his
  authenticity as an influencer. So, from fake followers, Fyre Festival and
  homophobic trolls, Joel is here to spill some influencer tea and tell us what
  life is really like behind the ‘gram. If you want to follow Gallucks, you can
