  Verified Views is back with a brand new invention... or at least, Gadgets Boy
  is!

  week, chatting all things 5G, sustainability, AR, VR and robotic drones. To
  say we had our minds blown would be the understatement of the century. This
  episode is not one for brands to miss; with unprecedented advice on how to
  work with influencers from idea conception, to packaging, to content
  creation... lean on those who know your customers best! Follow Tomi at:
