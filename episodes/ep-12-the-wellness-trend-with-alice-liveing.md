  Our next guest on #VerifiedViews is 4am riser (!) Alice Liveing, a woman who
  is leading both the social and wellness spaces, proving influencers can create
  authentic, holistic health and fitness content, alongside a message of
  self-love. This week’s episode with Alice focuses around the question of
  whether or not Instagram’s recent move to put age gates on diet and detox
  products being sold in-app, means we are heading towards a better balance of
  physical and mental wellbeing? Tune in to find out. If you want to follow
