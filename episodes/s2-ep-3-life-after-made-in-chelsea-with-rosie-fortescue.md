  From reality TV star to entrepreneur, Rosie Fortescue is a gal about London
  town, and found her way to the Connects sofa studio this week! We spent the
  session chatting about what life is really like behind the reality TV lens,
  whether or not reality stars make the best influencers, whether enough support
  is given to the stratospheric fame-os of today, and what makes for a good
  influencer-led brand. Follow Rosie's jewellery brand at:
