  It’s a special #VerifiedViews episode this week as we are LIVE in front of a
  studio audience! On the mic today are parenting influencers @Jeffbrazier and
  @Marthashappilyeverafter.


  We give them a grilling on where on earth they find the time to post and
  parent, the importance of being given free rein on campaigns, and the killer
  question… how would they feel about their kids becoming influencers too?
