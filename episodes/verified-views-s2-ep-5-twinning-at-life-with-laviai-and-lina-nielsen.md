  It’s not every day we get to interview Olympic hopefuls – let alone two.
  Laviai and Lina Nielson are identical twin athletes, on the road to a delayed
  Tokyo 2021. Raised in East London, Lav and Lina are blessed with brains,
  beauty and not to mention bags of talent. In the wake of COVID-19, the Nielsen
  sisters’ dreams have been put on pause, but their lives both on and off the
  track have not. So, what does the road ahead look like? Follow Laviai and Lina
