  If you’ve ever wondered what goes down at the Beckham’s infamous World Cup
  parties, this is the podcast episode for you. Tim Lovejoy first hit our
  screens as the host of Soccer AM on Sky Sports, a football show that raised
  the bar in every sense, in a format that has never been matched. As well as an
  accomplished TV presenter, Tim is also an author and podcast host. It’s been a
  decade since the glory days of Soccer AM… so, what’s Tim up to now, why was he
  peeing next to Puff Daddy at a party, and why is the emotional impact of sport
  so relevant? Tune in for two fans going head to head – Adidas Vs. Nike, City
  Vs. Chelsea! Catch Tim on Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch, listen to his podcast
