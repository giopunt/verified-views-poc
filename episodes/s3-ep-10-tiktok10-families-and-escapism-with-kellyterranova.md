  One flick through [Kelly](https://www.instagram.com/kellyterranova_/?hl=en)’s
  TikTok and we’re immediately in the mood for dancing! Proving addictive
  routines aren’t just for Gen Z and parenting doesn’t have to be a drag, Kelly
  joins us today for TikTok Ten, walking us through the effort involved to make
  an ad-campaign pop, the escapism of TikTok and why the creative risk is always
  worth it.
