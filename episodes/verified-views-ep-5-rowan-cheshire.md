  In this episode, Olympic skier Rowan Cheshire chats to us about what it’s like
  to be a young woman in a male dominated industry, spills the tea on working
  with global brands like Samsung and Superdry and humbly ignores the fact we
  think she’s the perfect role model for a generation of up and coming
  insta-athletes. Find Rowan on Instagram at:
